1.  Introduction
================

This is a log file parser/stats generator for Quake 3 Arena log files.  It takes standard Quake 3 Arena log files and generates cut down versions which it stores and adds to with any new log files.  These cut down log files are then used to generate stats pages in HTML format.

It will also generate stats for Rocket Arena 3, Urban Terror and Headhunters 3.

It is written entirely in Java, and should work with Java 2 (1.2.2) and higher.  A full Runtime Environment is needed to use this program, but it should work under any OS there is a Runtime Environment for.

2.  New Features (since 2.1)
============================

  - v2.3 is basically v2.2 code, but in a better layout and with extra output styles.
  - TopWeapons feature (conf file) that outputs the top X most used weapons for the server
  - LinkWeapons feature (conf file) that allows users to specify that weapons should be linked 
    into one output weapon, i.e. the Rocket Launcher (Explosion) weapon is linked to the Rocket Launcher 
    weapon to produce one output of totals etc
  - New 'percent' tag for weapons tables to show the percentage of kills using the weapon
  - Added colour mapping (conf file) to allow the specification of what colours to actually output
  - More of the special name codes are now stripped, like ^b
  - Major code changes to reduce the number of loops involved in outputing the data
  - New system tags added for outputing the Cutoff point and the number of top weapons shown

3.  Installation
================

Simply unzip the install file anywhere on your machine.  You should have the following directories:

  bin       - contains the java files and the main config file
  input     - should be used to hold the cut down log files
  logs      - should be used to hold the standard Quake 3 Arena log files
  output    - should be used to store the output stats files
  static    - holds the static HTML files that wrap around the stats files
  templates - holds the template files used for the output

You should now setup the config file (Q3Log.conf usually) to contain the values you require (the file is commented)

4.  Usage
=========

Drop your log files (games.log usually) into the logs directory and then run the program.  do:

  java Q3Log help

for help on the parameters you can pass in and what they mean.

Once run, you should have all the HTML files you need containing the stats.

If you want to customise the output you will need to edit the following files (in the templates folder):

  table_main.htm_           - the main page containing summary stats info
  table_weapons.htm_        - the top X weapons table page
  table_row_above.htm_      - each row of the summary stats table for people above the average
  table_row_below.htm_      - each row of the summary stats table for people below the average
  table_row_total.htm_      - the totals row of the summary stats table
  indiv_main.htm_           - the main page holding detailed information for each user
  indiv_oponents_above.htm_ - each row of the individual details page table for oponents above the average
  indiv_oponents_below.htm_ - each row of the individual details page table for oponents below the average
  indiv_oponents_total.htm_ - the totals row of the individual details page table
  indiv_weapons.htm_        - the details of weapons used for each individual user
  indiv_weapons_total.htm_  - the totals for the weapons used for each individual user

5.  Future Enhancements
=======================

No future enhancements currently planned.
 
If you have any suggestions or requests e-mail me at q3logger@wilf.co.uk.

I don't know of any bugs with the program as it stands.  If you find any please e-mail me a full bug report to q3logger@wilf.co.uk

6.  Distribution
================

Generally this program is under GPL licence terms.  Rough details are:

You are free to distribute this program as you wish, provided you don't charge for it and you include this readme file with the program unchanged (unless you make changes to the program that need to be reflected in here) *AND* you include the full source for the program.  If you want to put this program on a magazine CD/DVD/Whatever then please contact me at givememoney@wilf.co.uk and we can talk about it.

If you want to modify this program, feel free!  I have included the .java file to make it easier.  The comments are a bit sketchy, and the coding is very poor (I havent got time to look over it and make it anywhere near good), so good luck.  You can distribute your changed program as long as you don't charge for it, and provided that you include my name and e-mail address and state I wrote the original that you improved on.  Also, you should only distribute any versions of this program if they have a readme or similar file that states that it shouldn't be distributed for money.

7.  Feedback
============

If you use Q3Log to produce public stats, please e-mail me a link to the server.  I wont publish its location or any details about it if you dont want me to, its just always nice to see other people using Q3Log.

If you have any feedback or questions (and have read this file and the help generated by the program first) then please contact me at q3logger@wilf.co.uk

I play under the nickname Wilf, but don't usually go on big public servers.  I run my own home server now and then (Rocket Arena 3 mostly).  The IP address changes occasionally (that's Pipex ADSL for you), but at the moment its 81.86.197.48 (standard port), and its usually on Gamespy etc as Billy RA Server.

I also use the following IM clients:
  ICQ - 7625349
  MSN - oroblramuk@hotmail.com

My own servers stats page is:
